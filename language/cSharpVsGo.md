## C# vs Go

* Earlier Typescript was build on typescript, so microsoft chose to replace it with `GO`.
  * Port Code rather than rewrite.
  * 10x improvement in compile times in projects after `GO`.
  * Its going to take years to build C# with scratch. Time to completion is the key metric => `A 10x speed improve next year is better than 5x speed improvement over 5 years`
  * Pragamatic approach as special cases - `Not every solution can be answered with one language`
  * Roselyn compiler itself is written in `C#`
